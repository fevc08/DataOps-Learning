# 21 Days to Learn DataOps with ChatGPT

## Day 1: Introduction to DataOps and Version Control

### Theory
DataOps (Data Operations) combines agile, DevOps, and lean manufacturing practices to improve the speed, quality, and reliability of data workflows. Key principles include:

- Automation: Minimize manual steps in data workflows.
- Collaboration: Foster teamwork between data engineers, analysts, and operations.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Apply software engineering best practices to data workflows.

Version control with Git is essential in DataOps to track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain workflow transparency. Tools like GitHub or GitLab provide a platform to manage repositories and CI/CD pipelines.

### Exercise
Set up a GitHub Repository

Create a free GitHub account if you donâ€™t have one.
Create a new repository (name it DataOps-Learning).
Commit a Python Script

Open Visual Studio Code.
Create a Python file (e.g., hello_dataops.py) with the following code:
`print("Hello, DataOps!")`
Initialize Git in your local folder:
`git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Hello DataOps script"`
Push your changes to the GitHub repository:
`git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-repo-URL>
git push -u origin main`
